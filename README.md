# Coursera Machine Lerning Foundations #

This repo contains my coursework for Coursera's Machine Learning Foundations, a University of Washington course taught by Emily Fox and Carlos Guestrin. Both instructors are Amazon Professors of Machine Learning, and the course itself is part of the Machine Learning Specialization by Coursera.

Each folder in this repo corresponds to each week of the course.
